#Alan's Simple IO module (ASIO)

#The purpose of this module is to make IO simpler.
#You can open a file with a single function call.
#You can write data to a file with a single function call.
#You can open and load data from a file with a single function call.
#You can download a file with a single function call.
#You can download a file and write it to disk with a single function call.
